threex.cubecamera
=============

threex.cubecamera is a [three.js games extension](http://www.threejsgames.com/extensions/) which provides a helper for cube cameras. It is very useful when a given object must reflect a texture cube live. Just look at it, you can see the reflection as clear as a real life mirror! You can give your texture the color you want, for example in the demo I created a "gold" sphere to give it a shinier look. Be careful though, this requires 6 renderings of the scene every time you update it. It becomes expensive fast.

It shows a little bit shinier discoball.
TODO to port in its own demo.
It doesnt even use live rendering.
Use the "minecraft goes party" from nextgamefrontier talk.

How To Install It
=================

You can install it via script tag

```html
<script src='threex.cubecamera.js'></script>
```

Or you can install with [bower](http://bower.io/), as you wish.

```bash
bower install threex.cubecamera
```


How To Use It
=============

First you need to create a classic mesh, the one which gonna reflect the live texture cube.
In this example, we gonna create sphere with the color 'gold' like this.

```
var geometry	= new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.5, 32, 16)
var material	= new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({
	color	: 'gold'
})
var mesh	= new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
scene.add( mesh )	
```

Now we needs to create the cube camera which gonna update the texture cube live.
We do that like this.

```
var cubeCamera	= new THREEx.CubeCamera(mesh)
scene.add(cubeCamera.object3d)
```

Don't forget to update it when needed (likely at every frame)

```
cubeCamera.update(renderer, scene)
```

Now that we got the textureCube, we set the mesh material to reflect this texture cube.

```
material.envMap	= cubeCamera.textureCube
```

This is it! Now you got the live texture cube on your sphere :)
